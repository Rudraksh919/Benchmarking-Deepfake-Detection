# Deepfake Detection Benchmark

This project was developed as part of **Course Project (EE656)** and is inspired by the IEEE paper *“Towards Benchmarking and Evaluating Deepfake Detection.”*  

It focuses on building and comparing two well-known deepfake detection models — **Meso4** and **Xception** — to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and overall efficiency.  

The goal is to create a reliable benchmarking framework that evaluates deepfake detectors not just by accuracy, but also by their computational cost, robustness, and real-time performance.
